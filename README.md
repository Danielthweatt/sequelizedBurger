#Burger 
This is my first full stack app utilizing sequelize. 
It is the "sequelized" version of my previous burger 
app.  
##How to Use 
When the page is loaded, all burgers stored in the 
database will be displayed in their appropriate columns 
(devoured or not devoured). The user can then either enter a 
new burger or devour a burger. If a new burger is entered, 
it will be stored in the database and displayed on the 
page. If a burger is devoured, it will be moved to the 
devoured column and its new status as "devoured" will be 
saved in the database.
